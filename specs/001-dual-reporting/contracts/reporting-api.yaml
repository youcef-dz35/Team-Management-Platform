    Manages Source A (Project Reports) and Source B (Department Reports).
    Implements Constitution Principles II (Data Integrity) and III (Dual-Reporting Core).

    **Critical RBAC Rules:**
    - SDDs can ONLY access Source A endpoints
    - Department Managers can ONLY access Source B endpoints
    - CEO/CFO/GM/Ops Manager can access both
    - No cross-contamination between Source A and Source B
